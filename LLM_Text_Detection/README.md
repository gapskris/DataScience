# LLM Text Detection WebApp
This is a Deep Learning based WebApp. That can detectsüïµÔ∏è the text writer or classify the texts. Whether the text is generated by Large Languages Models(LLMs)ü§ñ or written by Humanüë®.

## Project Structure Understanding(Folders and Files):
- `README.md`: File for writing project documentation, execution documentation, etc.
